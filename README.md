# Figure flow
My implementation of the following task:
"There are some objects-figures: square, triangle, circle, trapezoid. 
Every single figure can be drawn. YOu can also receive its area and color. 
These figures also have some inuque methods: return radius/hypotenuse length/shape length/etc.
The task is to generate random array of figures and the number of objects is also random.
After the array is generated it is requiredto print the list of all objects we have and some information about them."
Sooooo! This program DOES fulfill this requirements:
1) All objects are generating randomly (position of the screen, type, color, ets);
2) List of all objects is being printed in the console including their properties;
3) You can also click on the element in the application window to see only this onjects's info;
4) Totally OOP(no GMO).
